# [florr.io](https://discord.gg/florrio) discord server art archive
This repository is an archive of all the art posted in the [discord server](https://discord.com/channels/668937237010055189/668940299577458700) before the art channel got changed from a text channel to a forum channel.
Unless we have made a mistake by not uploading an art here that you have made in the [florr.io discord server,](https://discord.gg/florrio), you may not request to add art here. Use [art-gallery](https://discord.com/channels/668937237010055189/1348388469138784356) instead.

If you would like to request to remove a file which you own from these archives, contact either me or the staff listed here:
